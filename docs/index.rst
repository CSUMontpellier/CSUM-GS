*******************************************

The Centre Spatial Universitaire de Montpellier develops 1U and 3U nanosatellites platform and missions.

Most of these platforms communicates in the UHF band of 70 cm (around 435 MHz). This frequency bands belongs to the amateur radio band.
It is possible for anyone to receives, demodulates and decodes radio packets from satellites in this band.

For some satellites it is possible to send telecommands to communicate with the radio amateur module on-board.

This repository contains a set of tools and scripts that you can use to interact with, and contributes to CSUM satellites operations.

The pages **1U Decoder** and **3U Decoder** are old version of the documentation. The scripts used are not maintained anymore, however you can find them in previous commit of this repository. The pages are still here for additional information.
