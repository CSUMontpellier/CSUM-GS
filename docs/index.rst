Welcome to CSUM GS Modules's documentation!
===========================================

The scripts in this repository can be used to establish a communication link with the Robusta family of satellite missions from the Centre Spatial Universitaire Montpellier (CSUM). The scripts are provided as a set of signal and data processing blocks that encode or decode radio packets that can be sent to or received from Robusta platforms. The CSUM is developing a 1U and a 3U platform. The decoding and encoding process for each platform is explained in the sections below.
